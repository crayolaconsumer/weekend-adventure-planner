## The Problem

You're bored. You know you *should* get out, explore, do something with your day. But the paralysis of "what should I do?" keeps you stuck. You scroll through review sites, get overwhelmed by options, and end up doing nothing.

Meanwhile, incredible places exist within miles of you that you've never heard of. Local cafes, hidden viewpoints, historic sites, nature trails — all waiting to be discovered. But the friction of finding them is too high.

**ROAM fixes this.**

## What It Does

### One-Tap Boredom Buster
Hit "I'm Bored" and instantly get a quality place to visit right now. No decisions. No scrolling. Just go.

### Swipe Discovery
Tinder for adventures. Swipe through curated local places — right to save, left to skip, up to go immediately. Every suggestion is adventure-worthy (no health centers or car parks).

### Adventure Builder
Have 4 hours? Build a multi-stop adventure with optimized routing. Pick your vibe: food crawl, culture day, nature escape. Let the app plan the perfect day.

### Smart Filtering
- **Travel mode**: Walking, driving, or public transport
- **Accessibility**: Wheelchair access, family-friendly options
- **Budget**: Free attractions highlighted
- **Time-aware**: Only shows places open right now

### Gamification That Motivates
Streaks, badges, and stats that actually make you want to get out. Not annoying — empowering.

## The Vision

ROAM isn't just an app. It's a movement to:

- **Combat the boredom epidemic** — Give people reasons to leave the house
- **Stimulate local economies** — Surface hidden gems, not just chains
- **Improve mental health** — Movement and exploration are medicine
- **Promote accessibility** — Everyone deserves to discover, regardless of ability or budget
- **Build community** — Help people appreciate what's around them

We believe the cure to "I have nothing to do" is just one tap away.

## Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** — Fast, modern frontend
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth, satisfying animations
- **OpenStreetMap / Overpass API** — Real place data, no API keys needed

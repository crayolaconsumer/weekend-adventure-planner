# App Icons

This folder should contain PWA icons for ROAM.

## Required Icons

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## Design Guidelines

- Use the ROAM brand colors:
  - Forest green: #1a3a2f
  - Gold: #d4a855
  - Cream: #fdfcf8

- The icon should work as a "maskable" icon (safe zone in center)
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using the compass/exploration theme

## Quick Generation

You can generate icons using tools like:
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/niceDev0908/pwa-asset-generator)

Or create them in Figma/Sketch with the ROAM brand.

## Temporary Workaround

Until proper icons are created, the app will still work but may not display
correctly when added to home screen.
